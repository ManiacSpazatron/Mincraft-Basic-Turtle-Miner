Noteworthy Considerations
--Guaranteed to work on Minecraft 1.12.2 CC:Tweaked CraftOS 1.8
--This turtle mining script is best used with Ender Storage and preferably a storage system that is able to pull items from a ender chest (like Refined Storage or Applied Energistics)
example:
![setup](https://github.com/ManiacSpazatron/Mincraft-Basic-Turtle-Miner/assets/103073028/5f8a5aca-d1bd-4a35-9a47-9a00dba4c76f)

For these scripts to work you need...
1. Have 2 different kinds of colored ender chests (like the ones from Ender Storage)
2. Fuel for the turtle in an enderchest (coal/coal blocks/blaze rods)
3. The ender chest containing the fuel must be in the turtle's first item slot
4. The ender chest for offloading items has to be in the turtle's second item slot

5. Type the name of the script
6. Your program should be running!
