SCRIPTS ARE STILL A WIP

There are currently 2 kinds of scripts.
--one that checks that checks fuel status after every block mined.
--and one that checks the fuel status after every 48 blocks mined.

Noteworthy Considerations



For these scripts to work you need...
1. Fuel for the turtle in an enderchest
2. Have 2 different kinds of colored ender chests (like the ones from Ender Storage)
3. The ender chest containing the fuel must be in the turtle's first item slot
4. The ender chest for offloading items has to be in the turtle's second item slot

5. Type "run " followed by the name of the script
6. Your program should be running!
